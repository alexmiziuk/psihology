				<h2>2. Information about the controller and the person authorized for data protection</h2>
				<p>Controller&nbsp;<b></b>The controller of users' personal data is Letim,<b></b>Ulica  Brigade Moris 12, 1330 Kočevje. Letim is designated as the authorized person 
					for data protection, who can be contacted at the email address&nbsp; toni@letim.si.<br>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>3. Personal data</h2>
				<p>A personal data is information that identifies you as a specific or identifiable individual. A user is
					considered identifiable when they can be directly or indirectly identified, especially by reference to 
					an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, online identifier, or by reference 
					to one or more factors specific to the user's physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
					cultural, or social identity. The controller collects the following personal data in accordance with 
					the purposes defined in the Policy below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>basic data about the user (name and surname, title, address),</li>
					<li>contact details and information about the user's communication with the 
						controller (email address, telephone number, date, time, and content of postal or 
						email communication, date, time, and duration of telephone calls)</li>
					<li>information about participation in events organized by the Church of Kočevje 
						(data about the event you attended, location and date of the event),</li>
					<li>channel and campaign – the method of acquiring the user or the source through which 
						the user came into contact with the controller (website and advertising campaign or action),
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>data about the user's use of the controller's website (dates and times of website visits, visited pages or URLs, 
						time spent on each page, number of pages visited, total time spent on the website, settings 
						made on the website) and data about the use of received messages (email, SMS) from the controller,</li>
					<li>data from forms voluntarily filled out by the user, e.g., in the context of contests,</li>
					<li>other data that the user voluntarily provides to the controller upon request for certain services that require such data.</li>
				</ul>
				<div><br><br></div>
				<p>The controller does not collect or process users' personal data unless the user allows it or consents to it, i.e., when ordering products or 
					services, subscribing to newsletters, participating in contests, etc. The processing is also allowed
					 when there is a legal basis for collecting personal data, when the processing is necessary for the
					fulfillment of contractual obligations, or when the processing is necessary for the legitimate 
					interests pursued by the controller (hereinafter referred to as "legitimate interest").<br>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>4. Legal bases for processing and purposes of processing</h2>
				<p>Letim will process your personal data for one of the purposes listed below based on the following legal bases:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>your consent or approval,</li>
					<li>fulfillment of the controller's legal obligations,</li>
					<li>based on legitimate interest,</li>
					<li>fulfillment of contractual obligations.</li>
				</ul>
				<div><br><br></div>
				<p>Letim will process your personal data solely for the purposes for which it was obtained and will not process it for purposes 
					that are incompatible with the purposes for which it was collected. Letim 
					collects only those personal data from the user that are necessary to achieve each 
					specific purpose.&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><strong>
					Processing for the fulfillment of contractual obligations&nbsp;</strong></h3>
				<p>In certain cases, the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment 
					of the controller's contractual obligations. If the user does not provide the necessary data, 
					the controller cannot conclude a contract with the user or perform the service.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The controller will process your personal data to fulfill contractual obligations for the following purposes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>contractual arrangement of business cooperation,</li>
					<li>execution of activities specified in the cooperation agreement,</li>
					<li>communication with contractors and other contact persons of the client for the purpose of carrying out activities 
						specified in the cooperation agreement,</li>
				</ul>
				<div><br><br></div>
				<div></div>
				<h3><strong>Processing based on consent or approval</strong></h3>
				<p>Letim will process your personal data based on your written consent for the following&nbsp;purposes:&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
					<li>for sending emails to inform about news, services, as well as events at the controller or with third parties,</li>
					<li>for monitoring the reading of sent emails, specifically which email you opened or did not open, which links you opened or clicked (which content you read or viewed), 
						and how long you read or viewed each piece of content,</li>
					<li>for segmenting users based on the facts from the previous point and further sending personalized (individualized) emails, meaning that different users may receive emails 
						with different content for the purpose of better (more relevant) communication and achieving a higher 
						response rate to the sent emails,</li>
					<li>for the purpose of analyzing the user’s journey on the website: where the user came from to the website (traffic source), to monitor the time spent on the website, which web pages they visited, 
						and which content they downloaded or viewed,
					</li>
					<li>for segmenting users based on the facts from the previous point and further sending personalized (individualized) messages through multichannel communication, meaning that different users may receive messages with different content for the purpose of better (more relevant) 
						communication with individuals and achieving a higher level of user engagement,</li>
					<li>for all other purposes for which you specifically consent while engaging with the controller.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div></div>
				<p><br>In all cases where you give consent for the processing of your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time via the 
					email address toni@letim.si.&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><strong>Processing is necessary for the fulfillment of Letim's legal obligations.</strong></h3>
				<p>We also process your personal data when required by law. An example of the purpose of such processing is the processing of your personal 
					data for judicial or administrative proceedings. &nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3><strong>Processing based on the legitimate interest pursued by Letim</strong></h3>
				<p>The controller may also process data based on legitimate interest, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms 
					of the user to whom the personal data relates, requiring protection of personal data, prevail over 
					such interests. In the case of using legitimate interest, the controller always conducts an assessment 
					in accordance with&nbsp;<a
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=SL">
						the General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>In certain cases, Letim may implement specific safeguards for the protection of your personal data, such as pseudonymization, encryption, 
					processing in aggregated form, and/or deleting certain types of personal data for further processing 
					based on legitimate interest, collected on the basis of one of the aforementioned legal bases 
					(consent, contract).&nbsp;</p>
				<p> Letim will process your personal data based on legitimate interest for the following purposes:&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Marketing, business, and other technical analyses, such as analyzing and determining which organizations the event participants come from, 
						keeping records of how many and which events the user has attended, and maintaining records related 
						to the certificates, certifications, and licenses awarded to event participants.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Preventing abuse, ensuring security, enforcing claims, or defending against claims in administrative and judicial proceedings. Thus, the controller 
						may, in the case of suspected abuse, process your personal data to identify and prevent potential 
						fraud or abuse to an appropriate and proportionate extent, and may, if appropriate, also provide this 
						data to the police, the public prosecutor's office, or other competent authorities.</li>
					<li>Direct marketing, including user profiling, based on previously lawfully obtained personal data. You may object to the aforementioned processing at any time 
						in accordance with the chapter Right to Object in this Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>5. Consent of a person under 16 years of age regarding information society services.</h2>
				<p>A person under the age of 16 may not provide personal data to the Controller or otherwise make it available when consent is required for such processing. On this legal 
					basis, the personal data of a person under the age of 16 may only be processed if consent is given 
					or approved by the holder of parental responsibility for the child (one of the parents or guardians).</p>
				<p>The Controller will never knowingly collect personal data from individuals that it is aware are under 16 years of age, nor will it use or disclose such data to any 
					unauthorized third party without the consent of the holder of parental responsibility for the child. 
					The Controller makes reasonable efforts, taking into account available technology, to verify whether 
					the holder of parental responsibility for the child has given or approved consent in such cases.</p>
				<p>The rules regarding the validity, formation, or effect of a contract concerning a child are assessed in accordance with applicable Slovenian law.</p>
				<h2 style="line-height: 150%;">6. Users of personal data, contractual processing, and data transfer to third countries (countries that are 
					not members of the European Union or the European Economic Area).</h2>
				<p>Only employees of the company Letim and data processors who are directly authorized for this purpose may access your personal data.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Letim will never share your personal data with unauthorized third parties.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>By using the websites and other services of Letim, you agree that Letim may delegate certain tasks related to your personal data to the processors 
					listed below. The mentioned processors may process your personal data solely on behalf of and in 
					accordance with the written instructions of Letim, within the limits of the authorization as defined 
					in the contract between Letim and the processor, and in accordance with the purposes outlined in the 
					Policy. The processors of your personal data must not use them under any circumstances to pursue any 
					of their own interests.
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>7. Retention Period of Personal Data&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>The data controller does not process personal data longer than necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data was 
					collected and further processed.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Personal data that Letim processes for the execution of a contract is retained for the period necessary to fulfill the contract and 
					for an additional 5 years after its termination, unless a dispute arises between you and the 
					controller regarding the contract. In such cases, Letim will retain the data for an additional 5 years 
					after the final judgment of a court or arbitration decision, or settlement, or if no court dispute 
					occurred, for 5 years from the date of peaceful resolution of the dispute.</p>
				<p>Personal data that Letim processes based on the law is retained for the period prescribed by law.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Personal data that the controller processes based on your consent or legitimate interest is retained by Letim indefinitely until you revoke your 
					consent or request the cessation of processing. Letim will delete such data before the revocation 
					only if the purpose of processing the personal data has already been achieved or if required by law.</p>
				<p>After the retention period expires, the Letim will effectively and permanently delete or anonymize your personal data, ensuring that it can no longer be linked to you.<br>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>8. Security of Personal Data</h2>
				<p>Letim is committed to protecting your personal data. It prevents unauthorized access, use, and disclosure of your

						these actions.</li>
				</ul>
				<div></div>
				<p><br>Unauthorized access to personal data, their use, and disclosure is prevented by Letim through the following security technologies and procedures:</p>
